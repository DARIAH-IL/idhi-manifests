# Slot: tags 


_Free-text tags for discovery, filtering and grouping; usable on any top-level entity. Deliberately NOT a controlled enum, but prefer wording that matches a concept in an established ontology or thesaurus (e.g. Wikidata, Getty AAT, TaDiRAH) so tags can later be reconciled against it._
